# APEXlang Prompt Contracts

Canonical contract for APEXlang agent prompting. Use this file as the shared rule source for the router and the Draft, Critique, and Revision agents.

## Purpose

- Reduce prompt drift by centralizing high-value behavior rules.
- Prefer compact, named contracts over repeated narrative guidance.
- Make prompt-governed behavior easier to enforce in critique, validators, and tests.
- Force a rules-first workflow: use the posted rules and workflows before any inference, and treat inference as a bounded last resort.

## Instruction Hierarchy

1. `references/policies/memory-bank/00-guard/ai.guard.md`
2. `references/policies/governance/00-governance.md`
3. This file
4. Phase-specific workflow prompts
5. Templates and examples

If a lower layer conflicts with a higher layer, follow the higher layer and mark the lower layer as defective.

## Required Tagged Sections

Core agent prompts must use these exact top-level tags when they apply:

- `<authority_rules>`
- `<task_scope>`
- `<allowed_sources>`
- `<exact_match_policy>`
- `<compiler_truth_contract>`
- `<generation_plan_contract>`
- `<output_contract>`
- `<stop_conditions>`

Rules:

- Keep tag names stable across agents.
- Use the same tag names in source and packaged prompts.
- Put reusable shared policy in this file; keep phase prompts focused on phase-specific behavior.

## Required Intermediate Artifacts

### Compiler Truth Evidence

Required when a draft introduces a non-exact-match structural edit.

Each entry must include:

- exact `query-valid-props` command
- checked component or parent scope
- conclusion
- emitted decision

### Generation Plan

Required for non-trivial page, component, or application generation before emitting APEXlang.

Minimum required fields:

- target artifact scope
- exact template family or variant selected
- region, item, and button inventory in output order when applicable
- source mode decisions such as `table/view` vs `sql`
- navigation or target decisions
- compiler-truth evidence references when required

Required response order for non-trivial structural generation:

1. `Compiler Truth Evidence` when required
2. `Generation Plan`
3. generated APEXlang

### Application Spec

Required before complete application generation from functional requirements plus model/schema metadata.

The spec must use `references/workflows/apexlang/application-spec.template.md` and include:

- source evidence and conflict status
- full page inventory
- application composition plan
- rich UI pattern plan using native APEX components
- LOVs, validation behavior, modal/report-to-form behavior, and test plan
- missing inputs and generation/runtime blockers
- project-root `.apexlang/app-ux-contract.json` with non-empty `sourceEvidence`, `pageInventory`, `compositionPlan`, `richUiPatternPlan`, `lovPlan`, `behaviorPlan`, and `testPlan`

## Workflow Precedence

Use this precedence order for every generation and revision task:

1. Apply guardrails and governance.
2. Apply the relevant workflow and template family.
3. Use compiler-backed truth and machine-readable contracts.
4. Stop with `Missing Inputs` or request human intervention when the rules and workflow do not answer the need.
5. Only then use bounded inference, and only for low-risk connective details that do not change structural legality.

Do not:

- guess when a rule, workflow, template, or compiler-truth step has not been exhausted
- skip to “best judgment” because a template seems close enough
- invent target pages, target item names, enum values, slots, or block shapes when the workflow cannot prove them
- treat local validator success as permission to infer missing structure

## Validator Feedback Contract

When local validation, live validation, VSCode Problems, `problems.json`, or `validation-report.json` emits rule IDs, feed those findings back into critique and revision using `assets/validator-fix-recipes.json`.

For each reported issue, the critique/revision loop must preserve:

- `rule_id`
- cause
- deterministic fix
- owning guidance or template
- verification result after rerun

If a rule ID has no deterministic recipe and the owning guidance does not prove a fix, keep the run blocked with Required Revisions or Missing Inputs instead of guessing.

## Rule IDs

### DESTINATION_WORKSPACE_NAME_REQUIRED_001

Statement:
- When a run will generate `deployments/default.json` for a brand new app,
  require the user to specify the destination APEX workspace name before
  materialization, record the selected workspace in session
  `context-resolution.json` under `db_context.workspace`, and stop with
  `Missing Inputs` if no exact workspace name is available from session
  context or explicit `--workspace-name`.

Why:
- `deployments/default.json.workspace.name` controls runtime target resolution
  and must not be guessed, copied from the scaffold seed, or inferred from app
  names.

Valid:

```text
Missing Inputs: destination APEX workspace name is required in session context before generating deployments/default.json for a new app.
```

Invalid:

```text
I reused the scaffold workspace name because the user did not mention one.
```

- Draft prompt
- Package prompt tests

### EXACT_MATCH_TEMPLATE_REQUIRED_001

Statement:
- Reuse a canonical template directly only when the component family and variant, parent context, nesting shape, and conditional mode already match.

Why:
- Exact-match reuse is safe. Near-match inference is a common source of structural drift.

Valid:

```text
Reused the exact `buttons.redirect-this-app.md` shape and substituted only labels, page numbers, and item names.
```

Invalid:

```text
Copied a calendar example into a cards region because both have links and titles.
```

Ownership:
- Draft prompt
- Critique prompt

### COMPILER_TRUTH_EVIDENCE_REQUIRED_001

Statement:
- Non-exact-match structural edits must provide compiler-truth evidence.

Why:
- Local validators and templates are incomplete guardrails.

Valid:

```text
Compiler Truth Evidence
1. Command: node tools/query-valid-props.mjs --component button --group behavior
   Scope: button behavior.target
   Conclusion: same-app redirect target must be `target: { ... }`
   Emitted decision: used declarative target object syntax
```

Invalid:

```text
I checked the templates and the validator passed.
```

Ownership:
- Draft prompt
- Critique prompt
- Package prompt tests

### RULES_FIRST_WORKFLOW_REQUIRED_001

Statement:
- Draft and revision must follow the posted rules and workflow first, and must not guess or infer while those sources still provide an unanswered next step.

Why:
- Most structural drift comes from premature “helpful” inference rather than lack of guidance.

Valid:

```text
The template family does not cover this exact shape, so I queried compiler truth next. The required target item mapping is still unresolved, so I stopped with Missing Inputs.
```

Invalid:

```text
The workflow did not spell out the target page, so I assumed page 4 because that seemed likely.
```

Ownership:
- Draft prompt
- Critique prompt
- Package prompt tests

### HUMAN_INTERVENTION_REQUIRED_001

Statement:
- When rules, workflow, templates, and compiler-backed truth still do not answer a required high-impact decision, stop for Missing Inputs or explicit human intervention instead of inferring.

Why:
- High-impact unresolved decisions should be escalated, not guessed.

Valid:

```text
Missing Inputs: target page and target item names for calendar navigation were not provided and could not be proven from templates or compiler truth.
```

Invalid:

```text
I could not prove the target item names, so I invented `P4_ID` to keep moving.
```

Ownership:
- Draft prompt
- Critique prompt

### APPLICATION_SPEC_REQUIRED_001

Statement:
- Complete app generation from FR/model sources must produce an implementation-ready application spec from `application-spec.template.md` before drafting non-trivial `.apx` artifacts.

Why:
- Rich application generation needs page inventory, composition, shared components, UI pattern choices, data evidence, and tests locked before page-by-page APEXlang drafting starts.

Valid:

```text
I completed the application spec, including the Application Composition Plan and Rich UI Pattern Plan, then generated page artifacts from that spec.
```

Invalid:

```text
I skipped the spec and started drafting pages directly from the requirements.
```

Ownership:
- Draft prompt
- Critique prompt

### GENERATION_PLAN_REQUIRED_001

Statement:
- Non-trivial page, component, and application generation must emit a compact Generation Plan before APEXlang.

Why:
- A frozen plan reduces plan/output drift and accidental re-decisions during emission.

Valid:

```text
Generation Plan
- Scope: page 12 interactive report page
- Template: page-examples/interactive-report-page
- Regions in order: summary -> report -> buttons
- Source mode: report uses localDatabase/sqlQuery
- Navigation: same-app detail link to page 13
```

Invalid:

```text
Draft
page 12 (
...
```

Ownership:
- Draft prompt
- Critique prompt
- Package prompt tests

### GENERATION_PLAN_DRIFT_001

Statement:
- The generated artifact must not drift from the frozen Generation Plan without an explicit plan repair.

Why:
- Equivalent late-stage rewrites create unstable output and inconsistent review behavior.

Valid:

```text
Plan says same-app redirect target to page 16; emitted target points to page 16.
```

Invalid:

```text
Plan selected a classic report, but the draft emitted an interactive report because it seemed nicer.
```

Ownership:
- Critique prompt
- Revision prompt

### DSL_MULTILINE_STRUCTURE_REQUIRED_001

Statement:
- Object-valued properties must emit `name: {` on their own line with nested properties on following lines.

Why:
- Inline compressed object syntax causes parser and import drift.

Valid:

```apx
viewEditLink: {
  page: 16
  items: {
    P16_ORDER_ID: &ORDER_ID.
  }
}
```

Invalid:

```apx
viewEditLink: { page: 16 items: { P16_ORDER_ID: &ORDER_ID. } }
```

Ownership:
- Validator
- Draft prompt
- Critique prompt
- `the source package regression tests`

### DECLARATIVE_BUTTON_TARGET_REQUIRED

Statement:
- `redirectThisApp` buttons must use declarative target object syntax.

Why:
- Same-app redirects using scalar URLs or bare `target { ... }` drift from compiler-backed syntax.

Valid:

```apx
behavior {
  action: redirectThisApp
  target: {
    page: 6
    clearCache: 6
  }
}
```

Invalid:

```apx
behavior {
  action: redirectThisApp
  target { page: 6 }
}
```

Ownership:
- Validator
- Draft prompt
- `the source package regression tests`

### TEMPLATE_OPTIONS_MULTILINE_REQUIRED_001

Statement:
- Multi-value `templateOptions` arrays must be bracketed and emitted with one accepted value per line.

Why:
- Inline comma-separated arrays are noisy, unstable, and easy to mutate incorrectly.

Valid:

```apx
templateOptions: [
  #DEFAULT#
  t-Report--stretch
]
```

Invalid:

```apx
templateOptions: [#DEFAULT#, t-Report--stretch]
```

Ownership:
- Validator
- Draft prompt

### TEMPLATE_OPTIONS_DEFAULT_ATOMIC_001

Statement:
- `#DEFAULT#` must remain one standalone template option value.

Why:
- Concatenated default tokens are invalid and usually indicate malformed serialization.

Valid:

```apx
templateOptions: #DEFAULT#
```

Invalid:

```apx
templateOptions: #DEFAULT#t-Report--stretch
```

Ownership:
- Validator
- Draft prompt

### CLASSIC_REPORT_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE_REQUIRED_001

Statement:
- Classic Report regions must use the canonical shared `appearance` block and the canonical report-template `componentAppearance` block.
- Canonical Classic Report component options are `#DEFAULT#`, `t-Report--stretch`, and `t-Report--horizontalBorders`; do not emit alternating-row or row-highlight options by default.

Why:
- This is a high-drift area where template and import behavior must stay aligned. Live APEXlang validation on 26.1 maps the Classic Report report template to property `411` and reports missing values as `componentAppearance - template (string)`.

Valid:

```apx
appearance {
  template: @/standard
  templateOptions: #DEFAULT#
}
componentAppearance {
  template: @/standard
  templateOptions: [
    #DEFAULT#
    t-Report--stretch
    t-Report--horizontalBorders
  ]
}
```

Invalid:

```apx
appearance {
  templateOptions: t-Report--stretch
}
```

Ownership:
- Validator
- Draft prompt

### CLASSIC_REPORT_COMPONENT_APPEARANCE_REQUIRED_001

Statement:
- Classic Report regions must emit `componentAppearance.template: @/standard`.

Why:
- The 26.1 compiler requires property `411` for the Classic Report report-template surface and reports the missing property as `componentAppearance - template (string)`.

Valid:

```apx
componentAppearance {
  template: @/standard
  templateOptions: [
    #DEFAULT#
    t-Report--stretch
    t-Report--horizontalBorders
  ]
}
```

Invalid:

```apx
componentAppearance {
  templateOptions: #DEFAULT#
}
```

Ownership:
- Validator
- Draft prompt

### PAGE_ITEM_LAYOUT_LABEL_COL_SPAN_LEGACY_001

Statement:
- `layout.labelColSpan` is a legacy alias and must not be emitted.

Why:
- The canonical property name is `layout.labelColumnSpan`.

Valid:

```apx
layout {
  labelColumnSpan: 3
}
```

Invalid:

```apx
layout {
  labelColSpan: 3
}
```

Ownership:
- Validator
- `the source package regression tests`

## Stop Conditions

- Stop with `Missing Inputs` when the posted rules, workflow, templates, and compiler-backed truth do not answer a required high-impact decision.
- Stop with `Missing Inputs` or explicit human intervention before using inference for high-impact structural decisions.
- Stop with `Missing Inputs` when compiler-backed truth cannot be resolved for a non-exact-match structural edit.
- Stop with `Missing Inputs` when required DB object evidence is unresolved.
- Stop when authoritative same-rank sources conflict and the conflict cannot be resolved from higher-ranked guidance.
- Do not use validator success as a substitute for missing compiler-truth evidence or a missing Generation Plan.
- Use bounded inference only after all higher-precedence rule and workflow sources are exhausted, and only for low-risk connective details that do not change structural legality.
