# Skill Authoring Guide

This repository is the Oracle-wide source for curated skills organized by domain at the repository root.

Use this guide when adding or updating skills so the repository stays consistent across Oracle Database, OCI, Fusion, and future domains.

## Goals

- Keep skills domain-oriented and easy to discover.
- Prefer official Oracle documentation over inferred behavior.
- Make each skill usable on its own without requiring the full repo.
- Keep file structure, tone, and metadata consistent across domains.

## Repository Model

Skills are grouped by root-level domain directory:

```text
.
├── db/
├── oci/
└── fusion/
```

Each domain should own:

- A `SKILL.md` file that explains the domain and how to navigate it.
- Topic folders or markdown files that stay coherent within that domain.

Domains can contain nested skills when a large OCI, APEX, Database, or Fusion capability needs its own router. For example, OCI Enterprise AI lives under `oci/enterprise-ai/` because it is a subset of OCI guidance.

Each installable domain `SKILL.md` must start with YAML front matter containing
`name` and `description` fields. Skill installers use these fields to discover
and validate skills. Optionally declare a paired domain with `depends` so
installers pull in prerequisite skills from the same repository (for example
`oracle-dev-db` pairs with official `oracle/skills/db` at install time).

```markdown
---
name: db
description: Oracle Database skills for administration, SQL and PL/SQL development, performance tuning, security, ORDS, SQLcl, migrations, frameworks, and agent-safe database workflows.
---
```

Paired domains should document precedence in both `SKILL.md` files: the project
or specialized domain wins on overlap; the generic domain is used only for
uncovered topics.

For a populated domain, organize content by category directories under the domain path and use the domain `SKILL.md` as the domain table of contents. The standard pattern is:

- Category-based subdirectories such as `admin/`, `security/`, `integration/`, or other domain-appropriate groupings
- A `## How to Use This Domain` section
- A `## Directory Structure` section
- A `## Category Routing` section
- A `## Key Starting Points` section
- A `## Common Multi-Step Flows` section

For stub domains that do not yet have real content, keep `SKILL.md` short. It should indicate that it is a sample domain skeleton and direct readers to the root `README.md` and this guide for the pattern to follow.

## Before You Add a Skill

1. Confirm the topic belongs in an existing domain.
2. Check whether the topic should extend an existing skill instead of creating a new one.
3. Choose a path that matches the current domain taxonomy.
4. Decide whether the content is version-sensitive and what Oracle versions it applies to.

## Path and Naming Best Practices

- Put the skill in the correct domain first, then the most specific category.
- Use short, stable, descriptive filenames in lowercase with hyphens.
- Keep one primary topic per file.
- Avoid filenames tied to temporary product marketing language unless that name is the official product term.
- Prefer paths like `db/sqlcl/sqlcl-mcp-server.md` over broad catch-all files.

## Research Standards

Before writing, gather source material from the most authoritative documentation available.

Preferred sources, in order:

1. Oracle product documentation on `docs.oracle.com`
2. Oracle-owned repositories and samples
3. Oracle-authored blogs or product team posts
4. Oracle LiveLabs

Best practices:

- Verify exact command names, flags, package names, parameters, and view names.
- Verify minimum version requirements for features and syntax.
- Distinguish documented behavior from inference.
- If a detail cannot be verified, omit it or clearly mark it as unverified.

## Writing Standards

Each skill should be practical, self-contained, and written for fast operational use.

Prefer this structure:

1. `## Overview`
2. Problem framing or core concepts
3. Practical examples
4. Best practices and common mistakes
5. `## Oracle Version Notes (19c vs 26ai)` when version differences matter
6. `## Sources`

Writing expectations:

- Lead with what the skill helps the reader do.
- Use short sections and concrete examples.
- Keep examples realistic and Oracle-specific.
- Explain why something matters when it affects safety, correctness, or performance.
- Avoid filler, speculation, and repeated background material.

## Version Guidance

- Use Oracle Database 19c as the baseline compatibility target unless there is a better domain-specific baseline.
- Call out features that require newer releases.
- When behavior differs by version, state the version explicitly.
- Provide fallback guidance when practical.

## Safety and Quality

Be especially careful with content that can cause damage or confusion.

- For DML and DDL guidance, prefer safe workflows and pre-flight checks.
- For security topics, prefer least-privilege examples.
- For operational guidance, separate required steps from optional optimizations.
- Do not include invented defaults, undocumented environment variables, or guessed CLI flags.

## Cross-Linking

- Link to nearby related skills when they materially help the reader.
- Prefer domain-local references when possible.
- Update the domain index files when a new skill changes navigation.

## Required Follow-Through

When adding, moving, or renaming a skill:

1. Update the relevant domain `SKILL.md`.
2. Update the root `README.md` if the domain layout or repo navigation changed.
3. Check for stale links and old paths across the repo.

## Review Checklist

Before submitting a new or updated skill, confirm:

- The file path matches the intended domain and category.
- The title and filename match the topic.
- Examples use valid Oracle syntax and terminology.
- Version notes are present when needed.
- All major claims are backed by official Oracle sources.
- The file ends with a `## Sources` section.
- Navigation docs were updated if needed.
