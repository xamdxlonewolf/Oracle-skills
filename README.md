# Oracle Skills

Oracle Skills is a collection of practical, installable skills for working with Oracle technologies.

The goal is to give developers and agents a single place to find source-backed Oracle guidance across Oracle Database, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, GraalVM, Oracle Fusion, Oracle APEX, and future domains.

## Installation

Install a domain by appending the root-level domain directory to the repository name:

```bash
npx skills add oracle/skills/db
npx skills add oracle/skills/oracle-dev   # pairs with db/; project schema standards take precedence
npx skills add oracle/skills/oci
npx skills add oracle/skills/graal
...
```

### Install in Claude Code

This repository also ships as a Claude Code plugin marketplace (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`), where each domain folder (`apex`, `db`, `fusion`, `graal`, `oci`) is published as its own plugin.

Register the marketplace, then install the domain plugins you need:

```bash
# Register this repo as a marketplace
/plugin marketplace add oracle/skills

# Install one or more domain plugins
/plugin install db@oracle-skills
/plugin install graal@oracle-skills
```

Already cloned the repo locally? Point the marketplace at the local path instead:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add ./
```

Browse and toggle installed plugins anytime with `/plugin`. Enabled plugins are tracked in `.claude/settings.json` under `enabledPlugins`.

## Repository Goals

- Provide Oracle-wide skills in one repository.
- Define domain entry points that help developers and agents route to the right topic quickly.
- Keep each skill practical, source-backed, and easy to consume on demand.
- Allow each domain to evolve its own taxonomy without breaking repo-wide consistency.

## Domains

- `db/` is the active Oracle Database domain and includes database, ORDS, SQLcl, framework, container, and agent workflow skills.
- `oracle-dev/` is the project-tailored Oracle schema development domain: naming conventions, natural keys, audit columns, lookup-table patterns, hand-run idempotent DDL scripts, and project prefix discovery. **Install this as your primary entry point for application schema work** — it pairs with `db/` and your project standards take precedence; `db/` is consulted automatically only for topics outside `oracle-dev/` (admin, performance, PL/SQL, ORDS, SQLcl, and similar).
- `oci/` contains Oracle Cloud Infrastructure skills, including OCI Functions deployment and troubleshooting, OCI Kubernetes Engine cluster design and troubleshooting, OCI IoT Platform digital twin workflows, plus Enterprise AI guidance for OCI Generative AI, agents, RAG, governance, model endpoints, Autonomous Database, APEX, and integrations.
- `fusion/` is the root for future Oracle Fusion skills.
- `apex/` is the root for future Oracle APEX skills.
- `graal/` contains GraalVM skills, starting with Native Image.

## Start Here

1. Pick the domain closest to your task.
2. Install that domain skill.
3. Add other domain skills only when needed.

```

Each domain has its own `SKILL.md` and any supporting index files it needs.

For a real domain, organize content by category directories and use `SKILL.md` as the table of contents. A domain `SKILL.md` should normally include:

- `## How to Use This Domain`
- `## Directory Structure`
- `## Category Routing`
- `## Key Starting Points`
- `## Common Multi-Step Flows`

For stub domains, keep `SKILL.md` minimal and point users back to this `README.md` and `SKILL_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md`.

## Version Coverage Standard

- Skills that include version-specific behavior must include a section named `## Oracle Version Notes (19c vs 26ai)`.
- Use Oracle Database 19c as the baseline compatibility target unless stated otherwise.
- Explicitly call out features that require newer releases and provide 19c-compatible alternatives where practical.
